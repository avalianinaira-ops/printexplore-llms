# PrintExplore — LLM Context

This repository publishes the `LLMS.txt` file for the PrintExplore store so AI tools can fetch it from GitHub and track changes over time.

## Store
https://www.printexplore9.com

## GitHub-hosted LLMS.txt (Raw)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avalianinaira-ops/printexplore-llms/main/LLMS.txt

## Notes
- This repo is intended for machine consumption and version history.
- If a separate LLMS.txt is also hosted on the store domain, GitHub remains the stable mirror.
